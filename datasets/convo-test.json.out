User1 enjoyment: so, what kind of neat hobbies do you have?
User2 disgust: well, i like gardening a lot, i like to be outside, um.
User1 neutral: i like gardening, i wish i had a green thumb, though.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: i've got a brown thumb. that's what everything turns.
User2 enjoyment: oh <laughter>, is, - but, do you tr-, keep trying anyway?
User1 enjoyment: i keep trying, uh, you know, you just can't, can't give up on it, uh, i, uh, i bought some, uh, plants from michigan bulb company <laughter> they send them to you all ready alive.
User2 enjoyment: no, no, i've never had any luck with their's.
User1 enjoyment: oh really.
User2 enjoyment: right.
User1 disgust: i guess, i guess these are going to croak too.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: since i've got cats, i decided to get some catnip.
User2 enjoyment: oh.
User1 enjoyment: lots and lots of catnip, so it's, it's still green, and it's been two days so i'm encouraged <laughter>.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> no, i, i haven't had, had good luck with that company, uh, i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably.
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: but, i've had to, to get my money back from them and had better luck with, with some of the, the more expensive companies.
User1 neutral: yeah, there's a, uh, -
User2 enjoyment: because they, -
User1 enjoyment: i don't know, do you have lowe's up there?
User2 enjoyment: uh, well, -
User1 enjoyment: its, uh, building, uh, contra-, or building supplies place.
User2 neutral: no.
User1 enjoyment: um, they, they also have a garden shop and,
User2 neutral: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: they, they offer just as good a guarantee, if you buy it from them.
User2 enjoyment: oh, that's great,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: now our local stores don't, don't offer any guarantee.
User1 neutral: um.
User2 enjoyment: but some of the, - the mail order ones that i've dealt with for roses and that, they offer through, through the first summer.
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: which - at least if they, if they take off the first year, they're probably going to come up unless there's, uh, a terrible freeze or something.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that. uh, i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff, so, i'm going to wait on those.
User2 enjoyment: oh, they're bulbs for spring or fall?
User1 enjoyment: uh, probably spring, but, uh, i don't much care about things like that. i'll, i'll make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: something, something, to keep me occupied, you see.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh, uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: i'll, uh, buy some plastic and make a little house and, -
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> cute.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, and watch the cats tear it up.
User2 enjoyment: right. i don't know that, do cats bother bulbs? i think more the mice or other rodents.
User1 enjoyment: they, they just like to get in and dig.
User2 enjoyment: oh, i see so if you have fresh dirt, they'll <laughter>, -
User1 enjoyment: oh, they love to dig. i had, i had some, uh, - i don't know what kind they are, i've already forgotten, - just regular old flower seeds and i planted them and i was so, i was so thrilled because they came up, i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place. and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that.
User2 enjoyment: uh, gee.
User1 enjoyment: so, i have to hang these things high, so they can't get to them. especially the catnip.
User2 enjoyment: how many cats do you have?
User1 enjoyment: three.
User2 enjoyment: oh okay.
User1 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User2 enjoyment: actually i just, put a, uh, little fence around my yard, uh, um, which is i suppose, technically illegal, but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it, and it, it's got this one inch mesh and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out and i love it <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: um, yeah, yeah, because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too. but, uh, why would it be illegal?
User2 enjoyment: well, because we have these tow-, uh, - i live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission.
User1 enjoyment: oh, uh, yeah, right.
User2 enjoyment: and, you know, they want, uh, privacy fences.
User1 enjoyment: well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right.
User2 enjoyment: right, right. well they do walking tours too, so. -
User1 enjoyment: um.
User2 disgust: but at least, because i back up to, um, a hillside where the, uh, wild animals are, i think i can probably justify it.
User1 enjoyment: um, yeah, an, and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.
User2 disgust: right, right, i me-, -
User1 enjoyment: you know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> right, the first year, the deer ate my garden, and i was just astounded. i'm going deer, right here in the city <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, right here, bambi <laughter>.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> exactly.
User1 enjoyment: uh, gosh.
User2 enjoyment: and so, -
User1 enjoyment: well, let's see, other than gardening which i fiddle at, i'm not very good at, - what else do i, mostly just computer stuff.
User2 enjoyment: oh.
User1 enjoyment: i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that. uh, cooking, that's not really a hobby, it's a necessity.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: but, but i enjoy it. i like to think that i'm a very good cook.
User2 enjoyment: oh, great.
User1 enjoyment: um, hobbies, that's about it. i don't have much time for hobbies, uh, between being a student and trying to run a business on the side, you don't have a lot of time.
User2 enjoyment: right that keeps you busy.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, and raising cats.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> i mean that could become a hobby.
User1 enjoyment: well, it's, it started out as a hobby actually.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: uh, it just, it developed into sort of a business, uh, you know, we breed them and all that, but, we didn't, you know, we didn't really start it for the money, it was just, they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an. and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh. what kind of cats are they?
User1 disgust: uh, i've got a, uh, a bombay, a turkish van and a himalayan persian.
User2 enjoyment: wow.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, the himie is probably the sweetest one. she's, she's just a little sweetheart.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: we, uh, - the, the bombay had a litter, uh, last october and w-, - i just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed. only going to breed them once.
User2 enjoyment: oh, okay.
User1 enjoyment: and, uh, she's not, she's not feeling too great today.
User2 enjoyment: um, is that typical, to only breed them once?
User1 enjoyment: no, uh, m-, most breeders are in it for the money, so they'll bree-, they'll breed them twice a year and i, +
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh, uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: i just think that it's kind of, i don't know, it's kind of cruel. you know, they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready, uh, and,
User2 enjoyment: right.
User1 enjoyment: you're never, you're never rea-, - and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too, and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh, uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and i just don't like that.
User2 enjoyment: so will, you, uh, breed one of the litter, then next year?
User1 enjoyment: we're, we sold all that litter,
User2 enjoyment: oh.
User1 enjoyment: um, we, - there's not that much call to, for bombays.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: um, they're, they're registered but they're not, they're not, uh, they're not show cats.
User2 enjoyment: oh, i see.
User1 enjoyment: uh, so all you can do is sell them as pet quality.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: uh, so what you've got is a registered pet. and, not too many people want bombays. they want things like himie persians and turkish vans.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: turkish vans, if you've never seen one, i mean, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred. it's just, uh, medium size short hair cat. it's got, - he's mostly white with, uh, brown and black patches.
User2 enjoyment: oh.
User1 enjoyment: but they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive. um, now the himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll, we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those.
User2 enjoyment: right.
User1 enjoyment: it's just the stud fees are so much, though. it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her. we, we want to breed her with a champion, so. -
User2 enjoyment: right. now these are long haired?
User1 enjoyment: yeah, the persian is,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh, uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and the other two are short hairs.
User2 enjoyment: right. uh, that's nice.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, she's, uh, she's sweet. going to have some nice kittens, i hope.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: she's, uh, she's, - if yo-, if you know what a himalayan is, generally they look something like, uh, - well they come in a lot of different colors. people don't realize it but they're sort of like, uh, siamese in a way. they have the, uh, they have the gloves on the paws and they're, they're usually two colored. uh, but this one is, uh, is she's, pre-, predominantly, uh, black but she has chocolate, uh, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters.
User2 enjoyment: gee.
User1 enjoyment: and yeah, she's, she's quite attractive looking.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh, uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: hope, hope the stud will find her attractive.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> and that she has kittens that look like her.
User1 enjoyment: and, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens. but we have to be careful, uh, you know, we have to get a particular color point, uh, stud. you can't just breed them with anything. we have to get a, uh, we have to get a silver point himie, so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens.
User2 enjoyment: i see.
User1 enjoyment: that's, it, that's the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with, can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know <laughter>.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> you can't just tell them that anyway, but <laughter>. -
User1 enjoyment: that's right.
User2 enjoyment: oh dear. well it really sounds like, uh, uh, a business more than a hobby.
User1 enjoyment: well actually, i mean, it, it is a business in a way, but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby. especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats. we're, we're about to get another breed, we're go-, we're going to buy a devon rex . and i didn't, i don't like devon rexes at first.
User2 enjoyment: what is it.
User1 enjoyment: it's a, well actually it's a mutant. it, it comes from england and, uh, fr-, in the county of devon.
User2 enjoyment: oh.
User1 enjoyment: and it's a mutant cat. and they're, they're pretty expensive, we're going to, we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one. um, they're very thin, they're, they're, they're long and lanky and skinny.
User2 enjoyment: um.
User1 enjoyment: and they have real short hair. it's curly, as a matter of fact.
User2 enjoyment: huh, interesting.
User1 enjoyment: um, yeah, it, it, it's a strange looking cat. uh, i didn't like them at first. they've got great big ears,


User1 enjoyment: okay. well, ho-, how do you feel about, uh, drug testing?
User2 enjoyment: um, personally, i don't have a problem with it, uh, i think, uh, as far as, uh, protecting fellow employees, protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do, um, it's justified. on the other hand, um, i do agree that it's, it's a, it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work.
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 disgust: um, i would never, i would never have a problem with anyone testing me, but i can understand why people would object. so, i guess, uh, i guess, uh, i'm kind of mixed on it,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: still at this point.
User1 disgust: i am too a little bit, i mean, i, i don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and, and, you know, obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth, but i don't really like having to do it. it, -
User2 enjoyment: that's right.
User1 enjoyment: and i don't like the idea of it, it's, it's, makes too much of a big brother type of thing.
User2 enjoyment: that's absolutely right. it, it, uh, i guess it all comes down to, uh, you know, a, a definition of, uh, how much out, outside activities affect your work and, uh, uh, granted, you know, that, - any, any kind of drug use on, on company property and whatnot,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: is, is definitely not acceptable. uh, uh, i don't think anybody would ever argue that.
User1 neutral: huh-uh.
User2 enjoyment: or, uh, any, any after affects carrying over into the workday but, um, you know, i don't, i'm not particularly concerned with what people do, um, after they leave for the day especially if i don't, if i don't, uh, see any results of it the next day.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, yeah, i think so too. but, you know, it's one of those things.
User2 enjoyment: well, it, it is, it, you know, - on the other hand you, you've got, uh, you've got the, uh, the possibility of people, oh, - you've got some people could be arrested for, uh, drug use, drug dealings and things like that, and, uh, if their, if their employers name hits the papers and that it's, it's, +
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: it's a mark against them, the company and, uh, you know, what kind of people work there, what, uh, -
User1 enjoyment: plus, i guess, if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time, then the company has lost what they've put into that employee,
User2 enjoyment: that's right. that's right.
User1 enjoyment: and their expertise or whatever.
User2 enjoyment: right. e-, even if it is, you know, a company policy of, uh, immediate termination or whatever, they still have to replace them.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: and, uh, there's, there's a lot involved there.
User1 enjoyment: well, do you think that, um, it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it?
User2 enjoyment: i think, i think the regular schedule stuff, um, that when you say everybody get out of it, that's a good point, i never really thought of it that way.
User1 enjoyment: well, you know, if, if they have time enough they can,
User2 enjoyment: yeah, if they really can,
User1 enjoyment: stay off of it.
User2 enjoyment: um, i think the big-, the biggest problem i've got is, is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment.
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: um, as far as the new hires, i, i hired on just early enough that i, i missed it. um, where the new hires were concerned but, uh, not, nobody, no, i don't think anybody questions that, um, testing someone as a, as a precondition to being hired but, um, for the conditions that, for our employment to change while you're on the job that's, i, i don't know, that, that's where i think that most people get upset. it's, uh, you know, it, it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and, uh,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: it's just, it, it's a really tough question and it, you know, it, - people have, have really quieted down after everything started but i still think there's a lot of, there's a lot of resentment.
User1 enjoyment: i think so too, uh, i know the, the group i was in at the time this all came up they, uh, were quite vocal about it, through electronic mail, boy, they just really,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: you know <laughter>, let them have it from one end to the other,
User2 enjoyment: you bet.
User1 enjoyment: vehemently but, uh, it has quieted down, but i don't think they probably feel any differently,
User2 enjoyment: no, that's right.
User1 enjoyment: and some, some of them did quit the company.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, i, i know of some people who did, uh, it was, it was indirectly related, you know, they could always come up with other reasons but it, it had a lot to do with it. just the, the whole attitude, because it's really, uh, it's just really, - it, it seems so un-, - t i, you know, with the, the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have,
User1 enjoyment: true.
User2 enjoyment: um, to all of a sudden, uh, search for attitudes and whatnot. you know, there's not a lot of pressure to, to vote the right way or anything else around t i. like there, like there is in some companies or at least, you know, - from what i've heard, -
User1 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: but, uh, - yeah <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, i wouldn't like anything of that nature, you know,
User2 neutral: uh-huh. no, i, -
User1 enjoyment: don't tell me what to do, you know.
User2 enjoyment: absolutely not, you know, it's, it's, it's, you know, - if you hired me i'll be, you know, - supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so, uh, you know, let's, let's stick with that original trust, i guess.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: but, uh, it's, it's still, it, it still remains a tough question and, it's, there's a lot of, you know, the whole, the whole department of defense, uh, reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot. there's a lot of different things that, uh, come into play but that was, - i think everybody, everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company.
User1 enjoyment: yeah. well, i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem, then that would be one thing.
User2 neutral: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: but i think it's too minor and too, you know, - in, in the whole scope of things this isn't going to, to have any real affect on,
User2 neutral: i really don't think so.
User1 enjoyment: what's going on in the street.
User2 enjoyment: yeah. i really don't because, some people are going to, are, are going to risk it, um, it may prevent, e-, - i, i guess, i guess what i'm trying to get at is, if it, if it, if it does help a few individuals maybe, maybe it's worth it.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: um, you know, it may prevent somebody who was, was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but, uh, i don't know if, you know, the, - it's, it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much. there, there's still a big question in my mind that, the, the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of, of mistakes on the testing,
User1 enjoyment: well, yes.
User2 enjoyment: is something that still bothers me. it, it's, -
User1 disgust: that, - yes. i, i think that could be a big problem, you know, i would just be irate if they said it was positive and i knew it wasn't,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: you know, that just really rubbed me the wrong way.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh. absolutely. and that, - i, i don't know if, uh, i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too. e-, even if you, you know, if you take, uh, a, a drug that was presc-, prescribed for you but the, the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin, - well, penicillin's not on the list but, you know, -
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 disgust: yeah, i, i think you understand what i'm getting at,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: it, it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and, +
User1 neutral: right.
User2 enjoyment: and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent,
User1 neutral: no.
User2 enjoyment: and, uh, those are the kinds of things that still can show up.
User1 enjoyment: i guess the one that really got me too was that, uh, - let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine, that's not allowed.
User2 enjoyment: that's right.
User1 enjoyment: you know, that's, that's totally out.
User2 enjoyment: that's right. i even had friends when i was going to college who were in, uh, pharmacy school and they could legally, um, provide medicine to their family mens-, frie-, family members and friends certain medicines were, were legal now i, i, i believe, you know, any of the, any of the ones we would, we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists,
User1 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: but, uh, um, there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and,
User1 enjoyment: oh, that's interesting.
User2 enjoyment: that can happen. but, uh, -
User1 enjoyment: well, i guess we've exhausted that one.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, yeah, i think so <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: <laughter> enjoyed talking to you.
User2 enjoyment: you too.
User1 enjoyment: good-bye.
User2 enjoyment: good-bye.


User1 enjoyment: well, what's your views on it?
User2 enjoyment: i think it's, uh, a good idea. um, i grew up, uh, - my teenage years were spent during the sixties, graduating, uh, high school in sixty-eight. um, i remember when the peace corps movement first came about, and i thought it was a very good idea at the time. i was one of those, uh, kennedy children, if you know what i mean.
User1 neutral: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: and, uh, right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school, have no idea what they want to do.
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: and there's a lot of things out there that we could do, uh, for our own country,
User1 neutral: sure.
User2 enjoyment: let alone other countries,
User1 neutral: sure.
User2 enjoyment: and i think that we've got the, the people power to do it, it's just, uh, - we need to channel it and focus it on some things that, that need some fixing up. um, ]
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: some examples are this, uh, some of the things, like jimmy carter's been involved in, uh, a little program to, you know, fix up housing for people.
User1 neutral: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: and there's a lot of housing,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: a-, i know in the area that i live in, that's run down and beat up, but it could be fixed up and used,
User1 neutral: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: and it's just, you know, sitting there wasting away.
User1 disgust: yeah, we're not too far behind <horn>. i graduated in seventy-one, so i'm, i'm same generation. i, i'm, - it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User1 disgust: i, i think, uh, <horn> i don't, i don't even think it ought to be, uh, voluntary, i think it ought to be mandatory. uh, for kids to either, either do military service, or public service, one of the two. uh, a lot of reasons for that, not, not just because i'm a, i'm a hard ass or anything.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: it's just that, like you say, kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do, and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus. and, i think that it might stop us some problems later on. i mean, you know y-, these kids will get their, their heads on straight, and, and figure out what they want to do, instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something. uh, it's, i think it would be good for them, uh, it helps mature them a little bit, and helps them understand the world, the way it really is.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, i think a lot of people grow up with, uh, with, uh, preconceived notions li-, what the world's about.
User1 enjoyment: oh, yeah.
User2 disgust: a lot of it has to do from too much t v,
User1 enjoyment: oh, yeah, yeah.
User2 enjoyment: and, uh, you know, it's, there's, there's a heck of a lot of difference between, you know, the intake that you get from t v and, and movies, and what you hear in school, and then what reality is.
User1 neutral: uh-huh.
User2 disgust: uh, i remember, uh, i've, i've worked since i was, - well, i started delivering papers when i was ten, and i had a real job when i was thirteen, so i've, you know, worked most of my life. but i remember when i got out of high school, all through high school was, - boy, i can't wait to get out of high school, i can't wait to get out of high school. and i wanted to go to college, and i had the grades to go to college, and i got accepted to college, but when i got out of high school, i kind of said, you know, what am i going to do now?
User1 neutral: uh-huh.
User2 disgust: you know, it's - like, you know, when i actually started working full time, and i, i got married shortly after getting out of high school. i, uh, thought i was smart, ran away and got married,
User1 neutral: <laughter>.
User2 disgust: and, uh, i remember there was a time, and within the first year of marriage, i said, boy wouldn't i give to get, be back in school,
User1 neutral: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: and just have to do homework, and, and go work my part time job.
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: because, life, and the reality of working for a living, and trying to make ends meet, is just so overwhelming to someone,
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: if they aren't prepared for it.
User1 enjoyment: and, and most of them aren't.
User2 enjoyment: that's true.
User1 enjoyment: i mean, you look, you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right ou-, i mean, even in high school, and, you know, y-, you wonder, where are the parents in all of this. you know, why isn't somebody stepping in and, and sto-, putting a stop to this. kids in high school are just too young to be married.
User2 neutral: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: they ha-, they have no idea what the world is like. they don't how tough it is out there to make a living.
User2 neutral: yeah, a, -
User1 disgust: uh, i mean, i was in the same boat when i left high school. i, my parents wanted me to go straight to college and i didn't. you know, i was ready, i was ready, i had wanderlust, i wanted to get out and see some things. so, i joined the air force and ended up staying there for thirteen years.
User2 neutral: um.
User1 enjoyment: um, but, i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time, and, and after traveling around the world a few times, i realized that, things ain't the way they seem.
User2 neutral: yeah.
User1 disgust: and i, i did a lot of growing up there, uh,
User2 enjoyment: yeah, i think once, once kids get out and see how other people really live,
User1 disgust: uh-huh. yeah.
User2 enjoyment: and know how bad off some people really are, and how good they've got it,
User1 enjoyment: that's right <throat_clearing>.
User2 enjoyment: and what it takes to have that good life,
User1 enjoyment: that's right.
User2 enjoyment: a-, if you're willing to work for it,
User1 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: then they're probably be more inclined to work for it.
User1 enjoyment: well, you know, it's just like you say, there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country, and, uh, you know, if, if you could have a thought of something like, uh, like a, uh, uh, a peace corps sort of organization. i mean, this would be so useful, just in, uh, for instance, just helping old folks.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh, exactly.
User1 enjoyment: you know, they, you know they need help, they don't have anybody to depend on, and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house, or do minor repairs, or something like that. y-, -
User2 enjoyment: you know, i've, i've s-, i, - my, my parents are in their late sixties now, and, um, so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: and, it's, it's really hard on them, and the, you know, the thought that i, i see the, uh, the mall rats, you know, walking around the mall, nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long, when they could be doing something to help someone. -
User1 enjoyment: uh-huh. yeah.
User2 disgust: and, uh, you know, yo-, there's a, uh, a nice warm feeling, i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger,
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 disgust: i mean, i was a boy scout and the whole bit and, -
User1 enjoyment: yeah, my mom's in the same position, late sixties, and, and it got to the, got to the point where, i mean, me and my brother both were, were gone, and she couldn't maintain the house, without large expenditures of money.
User2 disgust: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: you know, it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment. and, uh, i, i'm not, i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway, but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things. you know, like the, like the yard work and little repairs, and painting and stuff like that.
User2 disgust: yeah. i think there'd, there'd be a, you know, a, uh, economic benefit for, you know, everyone concerned,
User1 enjoyment: oh yeah, sure.
User2 enjoyment: those doing the work, and those receiving the, the, uh, the services.
User1 enjoyment: sure, i mean, i mean, the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: you know, that, - i, i remember when i was a kid, i used to do little, little things for the old folks around the neighborhood, and, uh, i know how it made me feel. <<pause>> you know, you s-, uh, - peop-, people just don't help people anymore. they're, they're out for themselves and, -
User2 enjoyment: yeah. i think, uh, president bush covered that in his, uh, state of the union address this year when he said that, you know, it's time for, you know, the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, well that's, that's the, that's the point we've gotten to, you know. every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government. and, y-, the government's going to be limited. i, where are they going to get the money? they're going to get it from us. and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government.
User2 neutral: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program.
User2 neutral: exactly.
User1 enjoyment: um, the thing that carter works on, uh, habitats for humanity, i was involved in that w-, uh, in montgomery, before i came up to north carolina,
User2 neutral: uh-huh <throat_clearing>.
User1 enjoyment: and, uh, it was, it was a pretty neat little program. we'd just go out, and they would buy a plot of land, and contractors and builders, and everybody else would donate their, their time, and, uh, the materials were at cost. and we'd put up houses. and, that was kind, that was kind of neat. i, uh, in a way, i think it's a little bit inefficient, but, but it's better than nothing.
User2 neutral: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: and, and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing. um, course, on the other hand, i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves, but just won't.
User2 neutral: yes.
User1 enjoyment: because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw, uh, welfare money than it is to work. uh, we did a, uh, a cost comparison in one of my courses, and we took all the benefits that a family, that a, a married couple with two kids would get under welfare, and what they would be making at minimum wage. and they came out four thousand dollars better a year, by taking welfare.
User2 enjoyment: yes.
User1 enjoyment: so there's no incentive for them to do anything. <<pause>> far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money.
User2 enjoyment: yeah. one of the things they tried to push through in maryland, and, uh, weren't very successful was that if you were an able-bodied person on welfare,
User1 enjoyment: you had to do something.
User2 enjoyment: you had to do some work. and, -
User1 enjoyment: yeah. a-, an-, and that's been tried, that was tried in alabama too, and it got shot down.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: i d-, and i don't understand the reasoning for it. i really don't. it, it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money, then they should return something to the public. i mean, if nothing else, go out along an interstate and pick up garbage.
User2 enjoyment: that's exactly what they were trying to get them to do.
User1 enjoyment: yeah. what do they, what do they do in maryland, do they use highway people or do they use prisoners?
User2 enjoyment: um, both.
User1 enjoyment: yeah. tha-, that's the way they did it in alabama, too.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, they use both.
User1 enjoyment: u-, usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there, <laughter> picking up trash.
User2 enjoyment: uh, they have a, they have another program in maryland that's called adopt a highway.
User1 enjoyment: uh-huh, uh-huh. yeah, we have that here in north carolina.


User1 enjoyment: so, do you fish?
User2 enjoyment: oh, yeah. my dad has a lake cabin, and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the dallas fort worth area. it takes us about three hours to get there. and we go, and we fish, and we catch a bunch of junk <laughter>. nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part, but it's fun.
User1 enjoyment: uh, from a boat or from shore?
User2 enjoyment: from the dock, from shore.
User1 enjoyment: oh, that's nice. uh, mostly catfish or, -
User2 enjoyment: oh, mostly we catch carp. if we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while. and, you know, we go ahead and eat those. but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry. what we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it. and, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd. usually, there's a pretty good crowd there, so we don't ever catch enough to eat. carp is usually pretty much fun. because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line. and that, that's a pretty good fight. so that's a lot of fun.
User1 enjoyment: yeah. a real light line, real light rig?
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: well, that sounds like fun.
User2 enjoyment: they fight hard.
User1 enjoyment: fish in colorado s-, different than that.
User2 enjoyment: yeah?
User1 enjoyment: mostly trout in the mountains.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, and in the rivers and stuff?
User1 enjoyment: yeah, yeah, mountain streams and rivers.
User2 enjoyment: are they good to eat?
User1 enjoyment: uh, yeah, very. yeah, very much there, you know.
User2 enjoyment: oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?
User1 enjoyment: um, by and large, no. but, but they're big fun.
User2 enjoyment: yeah. well, i've been, - is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that or, -
User1 neutral: what?
User2 enjoyment: are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber?
User1 neutral: i, i, i'm a fly fisherman.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 disgust: yeah, i, i cast a ways. i'm not highly proficient, but it's fun.
User2 enjoyment: i've never even tried that. my, - if i don't have a reel with a button on it, i tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then. you're not casting a weight on the end of the line?
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: you're casting the weight of the line.
User2 enjoyment: with the little thing on the end.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, well,
User2 disgust: yeah, i thought it had a weight.
User1 enjoyment: the fly on the end weighs nothing. it weighs less than the line.
User2 neutral: oh.
User1 enjoyment: so what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.
User2 neutral: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and you whip the line.
User2 neutral: um.
User1 enjoyment: as you whip it, over your head,
User2 neutral: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.
User2 enjoyment: um. so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?
User1 enjoyment: well, no, no. you fish upstream.
User2 enjoyment: oh, you fish upstream?
User1 enjoyment: right. and then you let it carry it downstream.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and then you reel it in, and you do it again.
User2 enjoyment: you hope that they think it's a bug and, +
User1 enjoyment: yeah, exactly.
User2 enjoyment: and eat it.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, exactly.
User2 neutral: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: jump at it. uh, from what i'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.
User2 neutral: that's a fish?
User1 enjoyment: no, no. it, it looks like a grub. yeah.
User2 neutral: oh, it's a, it's a lure.
User1 disgust: okay, whenever you, - yeah, a lure, a fly.
User2 neutral: i see.
User1 disgust: whenever you have a, something that looks like something else --
User2 neutral: uh-huh.
User1 disgust: -- and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.
User2 neutral: oh.
User1 enjoyment: all right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns --
User2 neutral: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: -- there's <sneezing>, excuse me. uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.
User2 neutral: um.
User1 neutral: uh,
User2 enjoyment: did someone just come up with this design, and, and you're going to make one for yourself,
User1 neutral: uh,
User2 enjoyment: or are you going to buy it?
User1 enjoyment: you can buy them. uh, i've got some. and,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in fall.
User2 enjoyment: oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year, huh?
User1 enjoyment: yeah, yeah.
User2 enjoyment: um.
User1 enjoyment: you know how that changes, the phase of the moon and, -
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> i guess so. we tend to use just bait.
User1 neutral: yeah. yeah, i, i, +
User2 enjoyment: and, a few lures, but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.
User1 enjoyment: you see, i'm from west texas.
User2 enjoyment: oh, are you?
User1 neutral: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: where are you from?
User1 neutral: lubbock.
User2 enjoyment: oh, i'm from midland.
User1 enjoyment: oh, another west texan.
User2 enjoyment: i went to college at tech, so. you've been out to buffalo gap fishing.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, yeah.
User2 enjoyment: yeah. i've been up there.
User1 enjoyment: it, +
User2 enjoyment: i didn't catch anything, but i've been up there <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: it, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, it's fun. it's lazy. take a picnic lunch. i used to do that with my dad. every once in a while we'd go out on a saturday and just spend the day.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: before it got too hot.
User1 enjoyment: well, there you fish mornings and evenings.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: and nights.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> yeah, we do most of our fishing at night.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: just from the heat of it all. that's one advantage you've certainly got on us.
User1 enjoyment: it, at times, gets incredibly hot here.
User2 enjoyment: it does? i've only been up there once. in the summer. well, no, i've been up there twice in the summer. but both times it was really pleasant. in fact, it snowed on us in, in, - gosh, when was that?
User1 enjoyment: june?
User2 enjoyment: we were in mesa verde park, and it was like the end of ju-. it was just before july fourth.
User1 enjoyment: oh.
User2 enjoyment: and it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees. we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better <laughter>. and here it went and it froze, and it snowed on us.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: we did not know what to do about it.
User1 enjoyment: fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water. it's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and,
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: seeing the squirrels and,
User2 enjoyment: do, +
User1 enjoyment: camping out, and eating out,
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: of doors and, -
User2 enjoyment: do you have to, do you wear waders when you fish?
User1 enjoyment: uh, i probably ought to. i just freeze.
User2 enjoyment: oh. goodness, it must be a little bit cold.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, yeah, well, you know,
User2 enjoyment: that's cold water around there.
User1 enjoyment: ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there.
User2 enjoyment: um. do you have any, -
User1 enjoyment: you know, i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,
User2 enjoyment: oh, i see.
User1 enjoyment: out there, and you know how it is. the water's kind of, -
User2 enjoyment: yeah. and you get, you get a little more carried away with it, and you move a little closer.
User1 enjoyment: and then you're in to it just a little bit, and then you splash in and,
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: the next thing you know, your knees are wet.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> do you have any kids that you take fishing?
User1 enjoyment: uh, got a stepdaughter.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: she's real sweet. and, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: a fuzzy little dog.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.
User1 enjoyment: oh.
User2 enjoyment: and the little one, of course, is, could care less.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: the, uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point, - we got him a little pole last year, and just put, uh, - his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up <laughter>. that was what he considered fishing <laughter>. this year, he's gotten to where he can. we, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm, and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal-, we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.
User1 enjoyment: yeah.
User2 enjoyment: and he started trying to cast it. so, he, he was kind of getting there but he's, +
User1 enjoyment: yeah, you guys sure want to be out of range.
User2 enjoyment: he's at a dangerous point right now <laughter>. he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.
User1 enjoyment: it takes time.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: yeah. last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to travers lake. oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time. and we still had a good time out,
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: of the deal.
User2 enjoyment: well, that's good.
User1 enjoyment: uh, and colorado is a beautiful place to live.
User2 enjoyment: oh, yeah. my husband would like to live there, but i don't know. all of our family is here so, -
User1 enjoyment: well, and you've got to have, you've got to work for a living.
User2 enjoyment: well, yeah, but t i is up there, so <laughter> that part of it would probably work out <static> <noise>.
User1 enjoyment: what division you all in?
User2 enjoyment: i'm sorry, what?
User1 enjoyment: what division are you all in?
User2 enjoyment: we're both, uh, - i was, uh, military, but he's division three. it goes back and forth. division, well, maybe division one right now. he's in computers.
User1 enjoyment: oh.
User2 enjoyment: so, -
User1 enjoyment: well, the only thing up here,
User2 enjoyment: and he's in school,
User1 enjoyment: is division one.
User2 enjoyment: and everything else. i have some friends who work up there.
User1 enjoyment: oh, yeah?
User2 enjoyment: kathy and kevin guy.
User1 enjoyment: okay. yeah.
User2 enjoyment: yeah. and they like to fish. they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer. her dad has a cabin, and they go fishing, up there.
User1 enjoyment: oh, fishing's, +
User2 enjoyment: so that would be neat to,
User1 enjoyment: fishing is fun up here. it's not, -
User2 enjoyment: try it some time.
User1 enjoyment: it seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there. but <sigh> it is fun.
User2 enjoyment: yeah,
User1 enjoyment: you know,
User2 enjoyment: long as you have a good time, that's the main point so, -
User1 enjoyment: the, the experience is, is better up here, i think.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: you know, it seems more relaxing, there's <static> more to look at.
User2 enjoyment: <laughter> definitely more to look at.
User1 enjoyment: and, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul <static>.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: you know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake, -
User2 enjoyment: yeah. the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up. we camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago. and we figured we were up a long way off. and then it rained that night, and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are? and we got up the next day, and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away <laughter>.
User1 enjoyment: <laughter>.
User2 enjoyment: and it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch. so, that was kind of funny.
User1 enjoyment: yeah, it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.
User2 enjoyment: yeah, i just love the way it looks. i could almost just watch the wa-, - we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much, and if you were there. i mean, it was, - one time we were there, and i guess it was late may, so it was really your spring almost,
User1 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User2 enjoyment: you know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here. and, and the, i guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt, and the creek was just wild, just running. and, and all the white water and noise and the, - it was just beautiful.
User1 enjoyment: yeah. i-, it gets f-, foamy almost.
User2 enjoyment: uh-huh.
User1 enjoyment: and you know it's just pure and pristine.
User2 enjoyment: yeah.
User1 enjoyment: and the froth and, -
