NRC HASHTAG EMOTION LEXICON
----------------------------
The NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon is a list of words and their
associations with eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust,
surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust). The associations were computed 
from tweets with emotion-word hashtags such as #happy and #anger. 
Refer to the publications below for more details.

The NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon is different from the NRC Emotion 
Lexicon. The Hashtag lexicon was created from tweets using emotion
word hashtags. The NRC Emotion Lexicon was created by crowdsourcing
and direct human annotation. To obtain the NRC Emotion lexicon
send an email to Saif Mohammad (saif.mohammad@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca).
The NRC Emotion Lexicon has entries for more than 14,000 English words.

The NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon was created just as the NRC Hashtag 
Emotion Lexicon, but it has associations with positive and negative
sentiment. It can be downloaded directly from here:

basic emotions). Version 0.2 was created using 72 hashtags (these include

FORMAT
------
Each line has the following format:
AffectCategory<tab>TargetWord<tab>AssociationScore

AffectCategory is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation,
trust, surprise, sadness, joy, or disgust).

TargetWord is a word for which emotion associations are provided.

AssociationScore is a value that indicates the strength of association
between the TargetWord and the AffectCategory. The higher the value,
the stronger is the association. Refer to the related research paper
for details on how the score is calculated.
